I've been playing with resque and hpricot for a project that needs to parse heavy xml files.  I've read alot of stuff online to help me start the project.  This is my way of giving back.  Here is a sample code using the following:

  - resque with redistogo  
  - hpricot
  - rails 3.0.3
  - rvm with ruby-1.8.7-p302
